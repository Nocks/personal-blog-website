# Personal Blog Website
My first project of the [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) course from Udacity.

## Introduction
In this project, I utilized my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure my files, and used proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.
